# To use this shell script program, copy and
# paste this text into a text editor and
# save the file to your hard disk. Be careful
# that the copy and paste does not introduce
# additional line breaks!
# Then make the file executable:
# chmod +x what_ever_you_called_the_file
#
# Now you should be able to run the program.
# ./what_ever_you_called_the_file
# The program will then tell you the
# parameters it needs.
#
# The program will create a subdirectory
# within the directory you save this script
# to hold all the entries generated.

# ******* NOTE *********
# This code relies on two programs other than
# the standard Unix command set, such as
# mkdir, sed, grep, rm.
#
# These two commands are: wkhtmltopdf and wget
# These two commands *must* be installed and
# in a directory listed in your shell PATH
# variable.
#
# You can check this from a terminal prompt as
# follows ($ is just the terminal prompt):
# $ wkhtmltopdf -V
# wkhtmltopdf 0.12.2.1 (with patched qt)
# $ wget -V
# GNU Wget 1.15 built on linux-gnu.
# ... etc
#
# You will need to install version 0.12.2.1 for
# the print out to be faithful to the Blip page
# layout. You can download that version from
# http://wkhtmltopdf.org/downloads.html
#
# Bear in mind that you have to trust that this
# download is safe!
